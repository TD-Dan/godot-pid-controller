PID and PD controller classes for godot

## What is a PID controller?

A PID controller is a feedback control algorithm that continuously calculates and adjusts the control output based on the error between the desired setpoint and the measured process variable. It consists of three components:

Proportional (P) term: It produces an output proportional to the current error.
Integral (I) term: It integrates the error over time to eliminate steady-state errors.
Derivative (D) term: It predicts the future trend of the error based on its rate of change.
